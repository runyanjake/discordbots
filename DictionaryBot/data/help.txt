You can command me by typing in a channel, or DM-ing me commands.
Note: Words are stored as lowercased and with spaces removed, so any string that transforms to the version shown can be used in a dictionary command. (e.g. "Rocket League" and "rocketleague" are considered the same word. `FOR NOW ONLY SINGLE WORDS CAN BE DEFINED IN THE DICTIONARY.`
My Bot Commands begin with `!`:
	`!definition [word] "[definition]"` - Defines the word [word]. PM's you for success or if anything goes wrong.
	`!define [word]` - Define a word to the channel you make the command from.
	`!redefine [word] "[definition]"` - Redefines the word [word].
	`!undefine [word]` - Removes the word [word] from the dictionary.
	`!words` - List all the words and definitions currently recorded.
