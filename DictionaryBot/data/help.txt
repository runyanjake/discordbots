You can command me by typing in a channel, or DM-ing me commands.
Note: Words are stored as lowercased and with spaces removed, so any string that transforms to the version shown can be used in a dictionary command. (e.g. "Rocket League" and "rocketleague" are considered the same word.
My Bot Commands begin with `!`:
	`!definition` -

	`!redefine` - 
	`!undefine` -
